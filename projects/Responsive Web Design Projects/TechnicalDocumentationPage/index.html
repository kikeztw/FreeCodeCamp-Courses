            Redux is available as a package on NPM for use with a module bundler or in a Node application:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  # NPM
  npm install redux
  # Yarn
  yarn add redux
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            It is also available as a precompiled UMD package that defines a window. Redux global variable. The UMD package can be used as a script tag directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            For more details, see the Installation page.

          <p>
            As the requirements for JavaScript single-page applications have become increasingly complicated, our code must manage more state than ever before. .
            This state can include server responses and cached data, as well as locally created data that has not yet been persisted to the server. 
            UI state is also increasing in complexity, as we need to manage active routes, selected tabs, spinners, pagination controls, and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Managing this ever-changing state is hard. If a model can update another model, then a view can update a model, which updates another model, and this, in turn, might cause another view to update. At some point, you no longer understand what happens in your app as you have lost control over the when, why, and how of its state. When a system is opaque and non-deterministic, it's hard to reproduce bugs or add new features.
          </p>
          <p>
            As if this weren't bad enough, consider the new requirements becoming common in front-end product development. As developers, we are expected to handle optimistic updates, server-side rendering, fetching data before performing route transitions, and so on. We find ourselves trying to manage a complexity that we have never had to deal with before, and we inevitably ask the question: is it time to give up? The answer is no.
          </p>
          <p>
            This complexity is difficult to handle as we're mixing two concepts that are very hard for the human mind to reason about: mutation and asynchronicity. I call them Mentos and Coke. Both can be great in separation, but together they create a mess. Libraries like React attempt to solve this problem in the view layer by removing both asynchrony and direct DOM manipulation. However, managing the state of your data is left up to you. This is where Redux enters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following in the steps of Flux, CQRS, and Event Sourcing, Redux attempts to make state mutations predictable by imposing certain restrictions on how and when updates can happen. These restrictions are reflected in the three principles of Redux.

            Core Concepts
          </header>
          <p>
            Imagine your app’s state is described as a plain object. For example, the state of a todo app might look like this:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  {
    todos: [{
      text: 'Eat food',
      completed: true
    }, {
      text: 'Exercise',
      completed: false
    }],
    visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED'
  }
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            This object is like a “model” except that there are no setters. This is so that different parts of the code can’t change the state arbitrarily, causing hard-to-reproduce bugs.
          </p>
          <p>
            To change something in the state, you need to dispatch an action. An action is a plain JavaScript object (notice how we don’t introduce any magic?) that describes what happened. Here are a few example actions:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  { type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Go to swimming pool' }
  { type: 'TOGGLE_TODO', index: 1 }
  { type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER', filter: 'SHOW_ALL' }
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Enforcing that every change is described as an action lets us have a clear understanding of what’s going on in the app. If something changed, we know why it changed. Actions are like breadcrumbs of what has happened. Finally, to tie state and actions together, we write a function called a reducer. Again, nothing magical about it—it’s just a function that takes state and action as arguments, and returns the next state of the app. It would be hard to write such a function for a big app, so we write smaller functions managing parts of the state:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  function visibilityFilter(state = 'SHOW_ALL', action) {
    if (action.type === 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER') {
      return action.filter
    } else {
      return state
    }
  }

  function todos(state = [], action) {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'ADD_TODO':
        return state.concat([{ text: action.text, completed: false }])
      case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
        return state.map((todo, index) =>
          action.index === index
            ? { text: todo.text, completed: !todo.completed }
            : todo
        )
      default:
        return state
    }
  }
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            And we write another reducer that manages the complete state of our app by calling those two reducers for the corresponding state keys:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  function todoApp(state = {}, action) {
    return {
      todos: todos(state.todos, action),
      visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(state.visibilityFilter, action)
    }
  }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </section>

           
        <section id="three_principles"   class="p-3 w-75 m-auto main-section">
          <header class="pt-3 mb-3 h1">
            Three Principles
          </header>
          <p>
            Redux can be described in three fundamental principles:
          </p>
          <h3>Single source of truth</h3>
          <strong>The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            This makes it easy to create universal apps, as the state from your server can be serialized and hydrated into the client with no extra coding effort. A single state tree also makes it easier to debug or inspect an application; it also enables you to persist your app's state in development, for a faster development cycle. Some functionality which has been traditionally difficult to implement - Undo/Redo, for example - can suddenly become trivial to implement, if all of your state is stored in a single tree.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  console.log(store.getState())

  /* Prints
  {
    visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_ALL',
    todos: [
      {
        text: 'Consider using Redux',
        completed: true,
      },
      {
        text: 'Keep all state in a single tree',
        completed: false
      }
    ]
  }
  */
            </code>
          </pre>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>State is read-only</h3>
          <strong>The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state. Instead, they express an intent to transform the state. Because all changes are centralized and happen one by one in a strict order, there are no subtle race conditions to watch out for. As actions are just plain objects, they can be logged, serialized, stored, and later replayed for debugging or testing purposes.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  store.dispatch({
    type: 'COMPLETE_TODO',
    index: 1
  })
  
  store.dispatch({
    type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',
    filter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED'
  })
            </code>
          </pre>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>Changes are made with pure functions</h3>
          <strong>To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state. Remember to return new state objects, instead of mutating the previous state. You can start with a single reducer, and as your app grows, split it off into smaller reducers that manage specific parts of the state tree. Because reducers are just functions, you can control the order in which they are called, pass additional data, or even make reusable reducers for common tasks such as pagination.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  function visibilityFilter(state = 'SHOW_ALL', action) {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER':
        return action.filter
      default:
        return state
    }
  }
  
  function todos(state = [], action) {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'ADD_TODO':
        return [
          ...state,
          {
            text: action.text,
            completed: false
          }
        ]
      case 'COMPLETE_TODO':
        return state.map((todo, index) => {
          if (index === action.index) {
            return Object.assign({}, todo, {
              completed: true
            })
          }
          return todo
        })
      default:
        return state
    }
  }
  
  import { combineReducers, createStore } from 'redux'
  const reducer = combineReducers({ visibilityFilter, todos })
  const store = createStore(reducer)
            </code>

            Prior Art
          </header>
          <p>
            Redux has a mixed heritage. It is similar to some patterns and technologies, but is also different from them in important ways. We'll explore some of the similarities and the differences below.
          </p>
          <h4 id="flux">
            Flux
          </h4>
          <p>
            Redux was inspired by several important qualities of Flux. Like Flux, Redux prescribes that you concentrate your model update logic in a certain layer of your application (“stores” in Flux, “reducers” in Redux). Instead of letting the application code directly mutate the data, both tell you to describe every mutation as a plain object called an “action”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike Flux, Redux does not have the concept of a Dispatcher. This is because it relies on pure functions instead of event emitters, and pure functions are easy to compose and don't need an additional entity managing them. Depending on how you view Flux, you may see this as either a deviation or an implementation detail. Flux has often been described as (state, action) => state. In this sense, Redux is true to the Flux architecture, but makes it simpler thanks to pure functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another important difference from Flux is that Redux assumes you never mutate your data. You can use plain objects and arrays for your state just fine, but mutating them inside the reducers is strongly discouraged. You should always return a new object, which is easy with the object spread operator proposal, or with a library like Immutable.
          </p>
          <p>
            While it is technically possible to write impure reducers that mutate the data for performance corner cases, we actively discourage you from doing this. Development features like time travel, record/replay, or hot reloading will break. Moreover it doesn't seem like immutability poses performance problems in most real apps, because, as Om demonstrates, even if you lose out on object allocation, you still win by avoiding expensive re-renders and re-calculations, as you know exactly what changed thanks to reducer purity.
          </p>
          <p>
            For what it's worth, Flux's creators approve of Redux.
          </p>

          <h4 id="Elm">
            Elm
          </h4>
          <p>
            Elm is a functional programming language inspired by Haskell and created by Evan Czaplicki. It enforces a “model view update” architecture, where the update has the following signature: (action, state) => state. Elm “updaters” serve the same purpose as reducers in Redux.
            <br />
            <br />
            Unlike Redux, Elm is a language, so it is able to benefit from many things like enforced purity, static typing, out of the box immutability, and pattern matching (using the case expression). Even if you don't plan to use Elm, you should read about the Elm architecture, and play with it. There is an interesting JavaScript library playground implementing similar ideas. We should look there for inspiration on Redux! One way that we can get closer to the static typing of Elm is by using a gradual typing solution like Flow.
          </p>
          <h4 id="Elm">
            Immutable
          </h4>
          <p>
            Immutable is a JavaScript library implementing persistent data structures. It is performant and has an idiomatic JavaScript API.
            <br />
            <br />
            Immutable and most similar libraries are orthogonal to Redux. Feel free to use them together!
            <br />
            <br />
            Redux doesn't care how you store the state—it can be a plain object, an Immutable object, or anything else. You'll probably want a (de)serialization mechanism for writing universal apps and hydrating their state from the server, but other than that, you can use any data storage library as long as it supports immutability. For example, it doesn't make sense to use Backbone for Redux state, because Backbone models are mutable.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Note that, even if your immutable library supports cursors, you shouldn't use them in a Redux app. The whole state tree should be considered read-only, and you should use Redux for updating the state, and subscribing to the updates. Therefore writing via cursor doesn't make sense for Redux. If your only use case for cursors is decoupling the state tree from the UI tree and gradually refining the cursors, you should look at selectors instead. Selectors are composable getter functions. See reselect for a really great and concise implementation of composable selectors.
          </p>
          <h4 id="Baobab"> 
            Baobab
          </h4>
          <p>
            Baobab is another popular library implementing immutable API for updating plain JavaScript objects. While you can use it with Redux, there is little benefit in using them together.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Most of the functionality Baobab provides is related to updating the data with cursors, but Redux enforces that the only way to update the data is to dispatch an action. Therefore they solve the same problem differently, and don't complement each other.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Unlike Immutable, Baobab doesn't yet implement any special efficient data structures under the hood, so you don't really win anything from using it together with Redux. It's easier to just use plain objects in this case.
          </p>
          <h4 id="RxJS"> 
            RxJS
          </h4>
          <p>
            Baobab is another popular library implementing immutable API for updating plain JavaScript objects. While you can use it with Redux, there is little benefit in using them together.
            RxJS is a superb way to manage the complexity of asynchronous apps. In fact there is an effort to create a library that models human-computer interaction as interdependent observables.
            <br>
            <br>
            Does it make sense to use Redux together with RxJS? Sure! They work great together. For example, it is easy to expose a Redux store as an observable:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
  function toObservable(store) {
    return {
      subscribe({ next }) {
        const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => next(store.getState()))
        next(store.getState())
        return { unsubscribe }
      }
    }
  }
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Similarly, you can compose different asynchronous streams to turn them into actions before feeding them to store.dispatch().
            <br>
            <br>
            The question is: do you really need Redux if you already use Rx? Maybe not. It's not hard to re-implement Redux in Rx. Some say it's a two-liner using Rx .scan() method. It may very well be!
            <br>
            <br>
            If you're in doubt, check out the Redux source code (there isn't much going on there), as well as its ecosystem (for example, the developer tools). If you don't care too much about it and want to go with the reactive data flow all the way, you might want to explore something like Cycle instead, or even combine it with Redux. Let us know how it goes!
